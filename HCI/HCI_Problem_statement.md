# Emotion-Driven Level Design in 2D Platformer Games: Exploring Player Behavior and Generative AI Applications

# Abstract

The research aims to design levels in a 2D platformer that evoke specific emotions frustration, excitement, calmness through level design mechanics. The goal is to validate and assess  the effectiveness of these designs in evoking the intended emotions using player feedback and behavior and explore how these insights could benefit future generative AI technologies in game design to improve player experience through the fine tuning of these emotions during playing experience.

## 1. Introduction (1.5 page)

Emotions play a critical role in gaming, influencing player engagement, satisfaction, and retention. Traditional game designs often focus on static mechanics, which may not cater to the diverse emotional states of players. This research focuses on the integration of emotion-driven level design in 2D platformer games, targeting specific emotions through carefully crafted mechanics. By capturing player feedback and analyzing behavior, this study aims to provide actionable insights for both game developers and generative AI applications.

## 2. Problem and objectives (1.5 page)

The challenge lies in creating levels that effectively evoke specific emotional responses, such as frustration, excitement, or calmness, while maintaining player engagement. Current static designs often fail to adapt to players' needs or emotional states, leading to a lack of personalization. There is also limited understanding of how specific game mechanics influence emotions and how this knowledge can inform generative AI systems for personalized game design.

Objectives

1. Design levels in a 2D platformer that target specific emotional states through tailored game mechanics.
2. Evaluate the effectiveness of these designs using player feedback and in-game metrics.
3. Identify patterns in player behavior and emotional responses to inform generative AI systems.
4. Demonstrate how these insights can improve game design and enhance player experience.

## 3. Methodology (2 pages)

### 3.1 Game Design

The game will include levels targeting specific emotions:
- **Frustration:** Narrow gaps, collapsing platforms, time constraints.
- **Excitement:** High-speed sequences, rewarding risks, dynamic enemies.
- **Calmness:** Soothing backgrounds, predictable patterns, minimal hazards.

### 3.2 Game Elements to Target Emotional States

- **Coins:** Number and placement to encourage exploration or risk-taking.
- **Power-ups:** Number and type (bonus or malus) to influence player decisions.
- **Enemies:** Quantity and type (stationary, moving) to balance challenge and tension.
- **Gaps:** Frequency and width (short or long) to impact difficulty.
- **Platforms:** Types such as disappearing, reappearing, or collapsible.
- **Music:** Calming or stressful soundtracks to reinforce emotional tone.
- **Backgrounds:** Soothing visuals or clustered, chaotic designs.
- **Time:** Constraints or penalties to add urgency.
- **Lives:** Number of lives and rewards (e.g., +1 life for achievements).
- **Checkpoints:** Number and placement to adjust frustration levels.

### 3.3 Data Collection

1. **In-Game Metrics:** Track retries, time spent, idle time, and erratic inputs.
2. **Self-Reported Feedback:** Post-level surveys to capture emotional states.
3. **External Tools:** Optional use of facial expression analysis for real-time emotion detection.

### 3.4 Analysis Framework

- Use clustering algorithms to group players based on behavioral and emotional patterns.
- Compare emotional responses across different level designs.
- Correlate player feedback with in-game performance metrics.

## 4. Evaluation (2pages)
### premleminary evaluation
### 4.1 Experimental Setup

- Players will complete levels designed to evoke specific emotions.
- Metrics like retries, completion time, and self-reported satisfaction will be analyzed.
- Emotional "hotspots" in levels will be identified using heatmaps and feedback.

### 4.2 Analysis

- Evaluate whether the levels successfully evoke the intended emotions.
- Identify player preferences and adapt future designs accordingly.
- Test the scalability of insights for use in generative AI systems.

  Insights

1. **Emotional Impact:** Each game element (e.g., gaps, power-ups, enemies) has a measurable effect on player emotions.
2. **Behavioral Clusters:** Players exhibit distinct patterns of frustration, excitement, or calmness, validating clustering approaches.
3. **Design Guidelines:** Specific mechanics (e.g., disappearing platforms) effectively evoke target emotions.

 Generative AI Application (evaluation)

This research provides a foundation for:

1. **Emotionally Adaptive Levels:** AI-generated levels that adjust dynamically to player emotional states.
2. **Automated Testing:** Generative AI models that predict emotional responses based on level design parameters.
3. **Personalized Gameplay:** Tailored experiences that optimize engagement and satisfaction.
